# Yacht Rental Prototype

This project is a mobile-first React application styled with Ant Design and a custom glass theme. After installing dependencies with `pnpm install`, you can run:

```bash
pnpm dev     # start development server
pnpm lint    # run ESLint
pnpm build   # build for production
```

The UI uses a custom theme defined in `src/theme.ts` and global CSS variables from `src/styles/variables.scss`.
